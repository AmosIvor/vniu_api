**Description**: 

The backend will be developed using C# .NET and will expose a RESTful API. It will handle data management, including a database for products, users, and orders. The backend will integrate AI capabilities, such as a chatbot for customer support and image-based product search. It will encapsulate the core business logic, security, and authentication. The architecture will be designed for scalability and performance, with comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms. By leveraging the .NET platform, the backend will provide a robust, secure, and seamless foundation for the application.
